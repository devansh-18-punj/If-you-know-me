# If-you-know-me

Hi there, I have made this quiz in which I have made questions related to me, you have to answer all of them. If you give 5 or more right answers, you will have a secret message from my side otherwise the code will exit.

You will be given random chances to answer the questions related to me, but if you get 0 by random, the code will exit automatically, your bad luck.

It's an intresting game, you will love it.
I have made this program with help of python modules like random and playsound.
